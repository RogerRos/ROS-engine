# ROS-engine
Fast access to your most used tools. (graphical interface, quick access keys...)

How to use:

      1. Copy the main.py to the desired folder to host the project.

      2. Make the necessary modifications to main.py (customize functions and increase the number of images and numbers in images=[]...)

      3. Add images to the same folder where main.py is hosted.

   Currently, the program would already work by running it through the terminal, but you can configure a quick key access if your operating system is Windows.

How to create a hotkey:

      1. Copy the .bat file to the same folder as the main.py.

      2. Create quick access to the .bat file and configure a quick key access. I recommend "ctrl alt t".

      3. Move the .bat file to a location that stays loaded like the desktop but I recommend:

         "C:\Users\"""YourUser"""\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs"

This way you will not load the file every time you start the computer and optimize the system.
